# ScoreCalculator
Avila Senior Capstone Project

Background for the Project: 
I was also part of a capstone team that was task to build a web based testing application for Avila's "Science and Mathematics for Young Women" competition they host at the university. My part of the project was to build the program that would take multiple comma separated text files, and calculate the scores for each round and determine the overall winning teams for the entire competition. That program I built mainly used PHP for the backend calculations, and HTML, Javascript and jQuery for the front end. 

I used Xamp to run a local server for the Project, Files needed to calculate the scorees had to be comma delmited 
File Formated: (Question number,SelectedAnswer,CorrectAnswer,Time) Note and "X" means the team ran out of time (40 seconds)
Test files are included in the Repo

User Manual Provided in Repo for using the web application.
